    AMENDUX PROJECT : Amendux Project TODO List
========================================================================

Update
    Once every boot or after so many hours the bot sould send a update request to the CandC. The server either
	responds with a can_update object including a location and checksum of the update.

Spreading
    We need a module capable of spreading the bot over the entire system. This includes named variants
	but also register keys and startup folders. 

Loading modules
    There should be an interface that can load external DLL's that are version checked and can be executed
	in separate threads. The interface must have a way of communicating back to a host or to the CandC.

Encrypted communications
    Traffic send to and from the CandC should be sealed with an encrypted box. This can only be done when the server side
	supports libsodium.

SSL
    It be great if the WebClient can support SSL domains and traffic

Optimize release
    Should be compiled to the max, be also strip all debug code
